# Claude Code Commands
Custom slash commands I'm using with Claude Code.

- [**create-issue**](commands/create-issue.md) A thorough github issue creator inspired by the [Cora teams workflow (youtube)](https://youtu.be/Lh_X32t9_po?si=husm7N8floLVHcMN) and [Swarmia's blog post](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/balancing-engineering-investments/). Transforms feature descriptions into ready-to-use GitHub issues with proper decomposition for complex tasks.
- [**debug**](commands/debug.md) An elite debugging strategist that discovers root causes through systematic validation. Provides targeted investigation plans and minimal, safe fixes with likelihood assessments.
- [**fix-issue**](commands/fix-issue.md) A pragmatic approach to solving GitHub issues following the 80/20 rule. Focuses on the simplest solution that delivers maximum value while maintaining code quality.
- [**refine-issue**](commands/refine-issue.md) Refines existing GitHub issues to make them developer-ready. Analyzes scope, updates outdated information, and converts complex issues into epics with focused sub-issues.
- [**review-pr**](commands/review-pr.md) A code review command that checks if a PR meets the requirements of an issue and defined standards. Evaluates adherence to SOLID principles, KISS methodology, and team conventions.
