# Claude Code Commands
Some custom slash commands I'm using with Claude Code.

- [**prepare**](commands/prepare.md) Helps preparing for a task, clarifiying user intent, creating ground truth. Often using it as a primer before enterering plan mode.
- [**streamline-docs**](commands/streamline-docs.md) Reviews and proposes improvements for documentation of the repo I'm working in. Keeps docs concise and accurate and lean.
