# Claude Code Commands
Custom slash commands I'm using with Claude Code.

- [**debug**](commands/debug.md) An elite debugging strategist that discovers root causes through systematic validation. Provides targeted investigation plans and minimal, safe fixes with likelihood assessments.
- [**issue**](commands/issue.md) Creates ready-to-implement GitHub issues from user input. Transforms feature descriptions into self-contained issues with proper decomposition through interactive clarification.
- [**ship**](commands/ship.md) Given a GitHub issue number, implements the exact requirements, creates a feature branch, and opens a pull request. Follows the 80/20 rule for fast shipping.
- [**pr**](commands/pr.md) Pragmatic pull request review focused on merge-readiness over perfection. Categorizes issues by impact and provides copy-paste fixes for blockers.
