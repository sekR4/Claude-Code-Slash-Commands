# Claude Code Commands
Custom slash commands I'm using with Claude Code.

- [**issue**](commands/issue.md) A thorough github issue creator inspired by the [Cora teams workflow (youtube)](https://youtu.be/Lh_X32t9_po?si=husm7N8floLVHcMN) and [Swarmia's blog post](https://www.swarmia.com/blog/balancing-engineering-investments/). The created github issue can than be used as a prompt... Kind of meta prompting, i guess.
- [**review-pr**](commands/review-pr.md) A code review command that checks if a PR meets the requirements of an issue and some defined standards.
