Review all documentation in this repository (READMEs, CLAUDE.md, docs/, any .md files).

## Phase 1: Inventory & Assess
First, list all docs found with a one-line summary of each file's purpose.

## Phase 2: Identify Issues (by category)
- **Outdated**: References to old APIs, removed features, wrong paths/commands
- **Redundant**: Duplicate information across files
- **Inconsistent**: Contradictory statements, conflicting instructions
- **Dead**: Docs for features that no longer exist
- **Unclear**: Ambiguous or confusing sections

## Phase 3: Prioritize
Rank issues by impact. Focus on what actively misleads or wastes developer time.
Skip cosmetic/stylistic issues unless egregious.

## Phase 4: Propose Changes
For each high-priority issue:
- Quote the problematic section
- Explain why it's a problem
- Propose specific fix (or deletion)

Do NOT auto-apply changes. Present findings first, then I'll decide what to execute.

Bias toward deletion over rewriting. Less docs > more docs if accuracy is equal.
